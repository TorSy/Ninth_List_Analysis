if u want me to recap the battle, do it, I can. I'm just going to give my opinion on the unit after the battle:
warlord on carno: He is tanky but no longer deals damage, little bit disappointed by what he did (and didn't).
skink high priest: pretty good, with four dices you can cast a comet (I cast one per turn, four did passed and the two others were scrolled)
skink priest: good scroll 
Dread elve: won't say anything because he isn't suppose to be there...
Captain skink on taurosaur: It's quite good, he did well, maybe I'm going to take back blowpipes next time;
30 braves skinks: the blow up to crisps while fighting 20 tallies... IMO it's not dat good without the AHD and a flame banner...
The bows skirmishers did well, I was impressed. It's not that OP but you can stay far from the opponent unit while shooting them. Good bunkers as well.
Chamos --> chamos 
Engine of the ancient --> very solid imo, -2 to cast is good 
sallies are OP if you can flank one unit (dear tallies, I must say...)
swarms are swimmers, they died by redirecting
